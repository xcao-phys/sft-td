# Statistical Field Theory: Exercise class material

Exercise class (TD) material for the course "Statistical Field Theory" of the ENS-ICFP Master 2 program. 

Faculties: Adam Nahum, Xiangyu Cao

The numerical exercises/demos are designed primarily for classroom discussion, and secondarily for self-study. 

The notebooks are independent of one another. To run them requires a Jupyter Notebook/Lab environment with python3, numpy, scipy and matplotlib (for example, Anaconda or CoLab). When there is no latex installed, like in the CoLab environment, turn off latex by adding a line "rc('text', usetex=False)" to the preamble block.
